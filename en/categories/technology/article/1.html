                    <h3>How was the Java Language conceived?</h3>
                    <p class="texto_justificado">
                        It is a programming language created in 1991 by James Gosling, Mike Sheridan and Patrick Naughton, a team of engineers at Sun Microsystems Inc known as the "Green Team". 
                        Sun Microsystems launched its first implementation publicly in 1996 as Java 1.0. The Java 1.0 compiler was rewritten in Java by Arthur Van Hoff to comply strictly with its specifications. 
                        With the arrival of Java 2.0, new versions had multiple configurations built for different types of platforms.
                        In 1997, Sun Microsystems approached ISO and later formalized Java, but soon withdrew from the process. 
                        At the same time, Sun made most of its Java implementations available free, despite being a proprietary application.
                        Sun generated revenue from Java by selling licenses for specialized products, such as the Java Enterprise System.
                        On November 13, 2006, Sun released much of its Java Virtual Machine (JVM) as free open-source. 
                        On May 8, 2007, Sun completed the process by making all the main JVM code available under the terms of the open-source distribution.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Java Properties</h3>
                    <p>The Java language was designed with the following properties:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h5>Interpreted and compiled language:</h5>
                            <p class="texto_justificado">
                                The Java source code is transformed into a bytecode that does not depend on the target platform, I mean,
                                allows it to run on any device that processes data in bytes.
                                These bytecode instructions will be interpreted by the Java Virtual machine (JVM).
                                The JVM contains the so-called Hotspot-Compiler, which translates performance-critical bytecode instructions into
                                native code instructions.
                            </p>                            
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h5>Object Oriented Programming Language:</h5>
                            <p class="texto_justificado">
                                Object-Oriented Programming is a way of organizing application code as a collection of objects as an instance of a class. 
                                Concepts that will be deepened during this article and other articles on this blog.
                            </p>   
                            <p>
                                The four basic concepts of Object-Oriented Programming are:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Abstraction</li>
                                <li>Encapsulation</li>
                                <li>Inheritance</li>
                                <li>Polymorphism</li>
                            </ul>

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h5>Automatic memory management:</h5>
                            <p class="texto_justificado">
                                Java manages the allocation and deallocation of memory  when creating new objects.
                                The application code doesn't have direct access to memory, however, the so-called Garbage Collector 
                                automatically deletes objects for which there is no active pointer.
                            </p>                            
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h5>Simple Language:</h5>
                            <p class="texto_justificado">
                                Java is one of the simple languages, as it lacks complex features, such as pointers, operator overload, 
                                multiple inheritances, explicit memory allocation.
                            </p>                            
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h5>Robust Language:</h5>
                            <p class="texto_justificado">
                                The Java language is robust, which means reliable. 
                                It is developed in order to place a large effort in checking errors as early as possible, so the java compiler can 
                                detect up to even those errors that are not easy to detect by another programming language. The main characteristics 
                                of Java that make it robust are Garbage Collector, exception handling, and memory allocation.
                            </p>                            
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h5>Secure Language:</h5>
                            <p class="texto_justificado">
                                In java, we don't have pointers, so we can't access matrices outside the limit, that is, 
                                shows <span class = "texto_destaque">ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</span> if we try to do so. 
                                That’s why several security holes, like stack corruption or buffer overflow, are impossible to exploit in Java.
                            </p>                            
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h5>Distributed Language:</h5>
                            <p class="texto_justificado">
                                We can create distributed applications using the Java programming language. Remote Method Invocation and
                                Enterprise Java Beans are used to create applications distributed in Java. Java programs can be
                                easily distributed on one or more systems that are connected to each other through an Internet connection.
                            </p>                            
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h5>Multithreading:</h5>
                            <p class="texto_justificado">
                                Java supports multithreading, which is the Java feature that allows running two or more parts of application using the best CPU performance.
                            </p>

                        <li>
                            <h5>Portable Language:</h5>
                            <p class="texto_justificado">
                                As we know, Java code written on one machine can be executed on another device, even with different Operating Systems.
                                The platform-independent feature of Java is possible due to the platform-independent bytecode and can run over all platforms.
                            </p>

                            The Java syntax is similar to C ++. Java is case sensitive, for instance, variables named myValue and
                            myvalue are treated as different

                    <h2 class="texto_destaque">Java Terminologies</h2>
                    <h3>Java Virtual Machine (JVM)</h3>
                    <p class="texto_justificado">
                        At run time, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) reads and interprets .class files and executes the application 
                        instructions on the native hardware platform for which the JVM was written. The JVM interprets the bytecode 
                        to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> Assembly language </a> instructions making the CPU understand it.
                        The difference is that the JVM is a piece of application written specifically for a given platform.
                        The JVM is the core of the “write once, run anywhere” principle of the Java language.
                        The code can run on any chipset for which the proper JVM implementation is available.
                        JVMs are available for major platforms, such as Linux, Windows and Mac, also for cell phones and other niche devices.

                    <p class="texto_justificado">
                        When you download a Java Development Kit (JDK), you get, - in addition to the compiler and other tools, 
                        -a complete class library of pre-construction utilities that helps you perform most common application development tasks. 
                        Read the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> JDK Documentation </a> for more details.

                    <h3>Java Runtime Environment (JRE)</h3>
                    <p class="texto_justificado">
                        The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) includes the JVM, code libraries, and components necessary to run programs that are written in the Java language.
                        The JRE is available for several platforms. You can freely redistribute the JRE with your applications, according to the terms of the JRE license, 
                        to provide application users with a platform on which they run your application. The JRE is included in the JDK by default.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Java Compiler (JAVAC)</h3>
                    <p class="texto_justificado">
                        When writing application on the Java platform, the source code is stored in .java files, and then the compiler compiles them.
                        The compiler checks your code against the language's syntax rules and then generates bytecode in .class files.
                        Bytecode is a set of instructions designed to execute on a Java virtual machine (JVM).
                        By including this level of abstraction, the Java compiler differs from other language compilers,
                        that write appropriate instructions to the CPU chipset on which the program is run, thus allowing portability.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Garbage Collector</h3>
                    <p class="texto_justificado">
                        Instead of forcing the application to maintain memory allocation (or use a third-party library for this), the Java platform provides non-standard memory management in other languages.
                        When your Java application creates an object instance at run time, the JVM automatically allocates memory space for that object from a heap memory pool - reserved for your application's use.
                        The Java Garbage Collector runs in the background, keeping track of which objects the application no longer needs and reclaiming memory from them.
                        This approach to memory manipulation is called implicit memory management because it does not require writing any memory manipulation code. 
                        Garbage collection is one of the essential resources for the performance of the Java platform.

                    <h3>Reserved Words</h3>
                    <p class="texto_justificado">
                        Like any programming language, the Java language designates certain words that the compiler recognizes as special. 
                        For this reason, they cannot be used to name your Java constructs.
                        The list of reserved words is surprisingly short:

                    <p class="texto_justificado">
                        A class is a description of reality, I mean, a blueprint for a discrete entity (object) that contains attributes and behaviors.
                        The class defines the basic structure of the object and, at run time, your application creates an instance of the object.
                        An object has a defined limit and state and can take actions when duly requested.
                        Each Object-Oriented Language has rules on how to define a class.

                    <h3>Java Package</h3>
                    <p class="texto_justificado">
                        With the Java language, you can choose the names of your classes, such as Book, Animal or Person.
                        You may end up using the same name to name two different classes.
                        This situation is called a name collision and occurs frequently.
                        The Java language uses packages to resolve these conflicts.
                        A Java package is a mechanism that provides a namespace - from an area within which names are unique, but outside of them they may not be.
                        To uniquely identify a building, it is necessary to qualify it including its namespace.
                        Packages also provide you with a good way to create more complex applications with discrete units of functionality.

                    <p class="texto_justificado">
                        An import tells the Java compiler where to find classes referenced within the code.
                        Any non-trivial class uses other classes for some functionality and importing is how the Java compiler is told about them.

                            import only the necessary classes, using their names in full.

                    <h3>Java Naming Convention</h3>
                    <h5>Class</h5>
                    <p class="texto_justificado">
                        It is possible to name classes as the programmer wishes, but the convention is to use <i>camel case</i>: start with a capital letter, change it to concatenated capital letters and make all other letters lowercase.
                        Class names must contain only letters and numbers.
                        Adherence to these guidelines ensures that the code is more accessible to other developers who are following the same conventions.
                    </p>
                    <p class="texto_justificado">
                        A class can have essentially two types of members: <span class = "texto_destaque">variables</span> and <span class = "texto_destaque">methods</span>.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Variables</h5>
                    <p class="texto_justificado">
                        The values of variables of a specific class distinguish each instance of that class and define its state.
                        These values are often referred to as instance variables. A variable has:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><i>accessModifier</i> (Access Modifier)</li>

                                    It is strongly recommended to avoid using public variables, but in extremely rare cases, they may be necessary, therefore, the option exists.
                                    The Java platform doesn't limit your use cases, so it's up to you to be disciplined about using good coding conventions, even when prompted to do otherwise.

                        Methods fall into two main categories: constructors or all other methods, of which there are many types.
                        A constructor method is used only to create an instance of a class.
                        Other types of methods can be used for virtually any program behavior.

                        Therefore, if you call your class <i> Person </i>, the name of the builder must also be <i>Person</i>. 
                        And for any builder other than the default builder, there must be an <i>argumentList</i>
