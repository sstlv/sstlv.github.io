                        The last few decades have seen several investments that culminated in the era of solar panels for home use.
                        Homes and businesses around the world are shifting from a fossil-powered electrical grid to a clean energy grid, generally based on solar energy due to the system's practicality. This strategy is necessary for emission reduction targets in an age of global climate change.
                        Amid this period of energy reform, roof solar panel systems for homes are taking off at a remarkable pace.
                        It's time to give home solar energy the credit it deserves.

                        Householders who install solar (photovoltaic) systems in their homes have several benefits: lower electricity-related costs and reduced 
                        contribution to carbon emissions, however, it is important to note that these benefits are very volatile from one residence to another, 
                        according to the general use of electricity.

                    <h3>Photovoltaic Solar Energy</h3>
                    <p>
                        Solar Photovoltaic (PV) technology has been around since the 1950s, but thanks to the drop in solar module prices, it has only been 
                        considered a financially viable technology for widespread use since the turn of the millennium.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The size of the solar panel is calculated based on the theoretical electrical production potential at 
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> watts </a>.
                        A 3 kilowatt-hour (kWh) domestic system operating at a 15% capacity factor would produce 3kW * 15% * 24h/day * 365 days/year = 3,942 kWh/year, 
                        or about one-third of the typical electricity consumption of a developed country, like the USA for example.

                    <h3>How it works?</h3>
                    <p class="texto_justificado">
                        Two main technologies can take the sun's energy and turn it into electricity.
                        The first is the photovoltaic or PV that you have probably heard of for its popularity. 
                        The process begins when the sun shines on a solar panel, and photons from the sunlight are absorbed by the cells in the panel, 
                        which creates an electric field through the layers and causes electricity to flow.
                    </p>
                    <p class="texto_justificado">
                        The second technology is the or Concentrating Solar Power (CSP). 
                        It is mainly used in very large power plants and is not suitable for residential use.
                        This technology uses mirrors to reflect and focus sunlight on receivers that collect solar energy and convert it into heat, 
                        which can be used to produce electricity.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Types of residential solar energy</h3>
                    <p class="texto_justificado">
                        There are three main residential photovoltaic power generation systems: <span class="texto_destaque">on-grid</span>, <span class="texto_destaque">off-grid</span>, and <span class="texto_destaque">hybrid systems</span>.

                                <span class="texto_boldado">On-grid:</span>
                                when despite the existence of individual energy generation, the residence is connected to an electrical network.
                                In this way, any surplus energy is sent to the grid and the owner of the residence gets a discount on his bill, 
                                also, if the generation of energy is not enough to meet the needs of the residence, the electric network supplies the rest.

                                The surplus energy generated by the photovoltaic plates can be stored in batteries, in order to guarantee the supply even on rainy, cloudy days, or at night.

                        Solar panels are built to work in all climates, but in some cases, roofs may not be suitable for solar systems due to no direct sunlight.
                        If there is an obstacle that creates a shadow to the solar panels, there may be a loss of performance in capturing the photons needed for energy production.
                        The size, shape, and slope of the roof are also important factors to consider.
                        Typically, solar panels perform best on south-facing roofs with a slope between 15 and 40 degrees, although other roofs may also be suitable.

                        Before starting the process of installing a solar energy system in a residence, it is important to analyze the use of electricity and consider possible efficiency upgrades, that is, new equipment to be added to the residence, loss of energy efficiency of some existing equipment.
                        Owners should be well aware of their total electricity usage and consider low cost and easy to implement efficiency measures before choosing solar energy. Consider the following factors to improve electricity consumption in the home:

                        Currently, it is recommended that a qualified technician does the installation because it is electricity and there are safety factors to be considered.
                        However, very soon, it may be possible to install solar energy on its own by creating a plug-and-play system of system components.

                        technician for the installation, in a few days the system will be fully installed and ready for use. The exact time depends on several factors. 
                        For instance, if an on-grid system is being configured, the process will take an additional time until the panels are properly connected to the network. 
                        Generally, although the decision process for solar panels can take some time, the installation time is very fast and quite simple.
                    </p>
                    <p class="texto_justificado">
                        High places with difficult access increase the level of difficulty in the installation process of the solar panels and generate security risk for the installers, and this can directly affect the cost.
                        In more extreme cases, it may even be necessary to hire a small crane to lift the panels to the installation site.
                        On the other hand, metal roofs and slabs are easier to install the solar energy capture modules, in contrast to the very inclined roofs, with clay tiles (fiber cement) that require greater skill from the installers.

                    <h3>Costs</h3>
                    <p class="texto_justificado">
                        Solar energy requires intensive capital, and the main cost of owning a system is anticipated when purchasing the equipment.
                        Solar modules will almost certainly represent the largest single component of overall expenditure.
                        Other equipment required for installation includes an inverter (to transform the direct current produced by the panel into the alternating current used by household appliances), measuring equipment (if it is necessary to see how much energy is produced), and various components of the box along with cables and wiring.
                        When considering the storage of surplus energy produced, a battery system must be installed.

                        <p class="texto_destaque">
                            Batteries have also been one of the components that make the system as a whole more expensive. And the cost of labor must also be considered.
                        </p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p class="texto_justificado">
                        In addition to the acquisition and installation costs, there are some additional costs associated with the operation and maintenance of photovoltaic solar panels.
                        In addition to cleaning the panels regularly, the inverters and batteries (if installed) usually need to be replaced after several years of use.
                    </p>
                    <p class="texto_justificado">
                        A solar system can theoretically be assessed using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method.
                        Outflow flows at the beginning of the project would consist of installation costs and inflows would arrive later in the form of compensated electricity costs.
                    </p>
                    <p class="texto_justificado">
                        Instead of using DCF, the viability of solar energy is usually assessed by calculating the Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE), 
                        comparing it with the cost of electricity charged by the local network provider.
                        The LCOE for residential solar energy will normally be calculated as <span class = "texto_destaque">cost/kilowatt-hour (kWh)</span>, the same format commonly used in electricity bills.
                        To approximate the LCOE, the following equation can be used:
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>LCOE ($/kWh) = Net Present Value (NPV) of the Lifetime Cost of Ownership ($)/Lifetime Energy Output (kWh) </code></pre>
                    <p class="texto_justificado">
                        The useful life of a photovoltaic solar module is generally considered to be 25 to 40 years.
                        The cost of ownership includes maintenance costs, which must be discounted to find the NPV.
                        The LCOE can then be compared to a utility's electricity cost; 
                        remembering that the relevant price is that which occurs during peak periods or close to the peak of solar photovoltaic production.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Benefits</h3>
                    <p class="texto_justificado">
                        At the outset, the most significant benefit in the installation of photovoltaic energy is the drop in the cost of the electricity bill, 
                        but the magnitude of this benefit depends on the quantity and quality of solar energy that can be produced, given the conditions available and the way the concessionaires charge for electricity.
                    </p>
                    <p class="texto_justificado">
                        Initially, one should consider the levels of solar radiation available in the geographic location of the residence.
                        When it comes to using solar panels, being closer to the equator is usually better, but other factors must be considered.
                        Equally important is the orientation of the house; for roof arrays, a south-facing roof without obstacles that creates shadows for the area where the panels are to be installed maximizes the available solar energy.
                        When this requirement cannot be satisfied, the panels can be mounted on supports that allow their installation away from the home, logically incurring additional costs with support hardware and extra cables.
                    </p>
                    <p class="texto_justificado">
                        Consideration should also be given to the time taken to produce solar energy and how utilities charge for electricity.
                        The generation of solar energy occurs mainly in the afternoon and is greater during the summer, therefore corresponding relatively well to the general demand for electricity in hot climates because it is during these periods that air conditioning devices consume the most energy.
                        Solar energy is valuable because alternative energy production methods (usually natural gas plants) used to meet peak energy demand tend to be expensive. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="texto_justificado">
                        Another benefit of a solar system is that homeowners can sell the excess electricity generated by their solar energy systems to utilities.

                    <h2 class="texto_destaque">Solar Energy in Mozambique</h2>
                    <p class="texto_justificado">
                        Recently, there has been great adherence to domestic solar systems in Mozambique, with more than four million families living outside the electricity grid.
                        However, the poor accessibility of solar photovoltaic systems by low-income families has meant that their growth is not as significant as expected, considering the number of families that do not benefit from the electricity grid.
                        Such accessibility can be influenced by high taxes on imports of products needed for solar energy systems, 
                        for which most East African countries have provided tax incentives, leading to millions of electrified families in Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania and Rwanda for instance.
                    </p>
                    <p class="texto_justificado">
                        The most common business model involving solar energy in Mozambique is Pay As You Go (PAYGo) in which companies sell services and/or products to customers through a prepaid model.
                        In the case of products, PAYGo is a form of payment in small installments for people who cannot pay or don't wish to buy products in cash.
                        Under PAYGo, companies not only provide products and services, but also the necessary financing for consumers.
                        Customers generally pay 10 to 20% as an initial cost and pay installments for a period of 1-2 years.
                        For PAYGo, it can take more than 3 years to make a profit.
                    </p>
                    <p class="texto_justificado">
                        Under this model, for-profit companies such as

                        they buy a high-quality plug and play solar systems, often with accessories like lights, radios, and TVs to sell to low-income rural homes that still use dirty and dangerous fuels like kerosene and candles to light their homes. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="texto_justificado">
                        Although there are many factors that lead to the success of a PAYGo business, one of the biggest factors is the support of tax incentives for the generation of solar energy and storage devices.
                        The East African Community introduced VAT exemptions and import duties for domestic solar systems in 2013, leading to a surge in growth in off-grid rural electrification.
                        In West Africa, where off-grid electrification has been more modest, tax incentives are inconsistent or opaque in their application to off-grid solar energy.
                        In Mozambique, the situation is transparent, but there are no incentives available for the sector.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="texto_destaque">Conclusion</h2>
                    <p class="texto_justificado">
                        Deciding to install a solar photovoltaic system may seem like a difficult task, but it is important to remember that such a system is a long-term investment.
                        In many places, solar energy is a good choice from a financial perspective.
                        Even though the cost of solar energy is marginally more expensive than electricity purchased from a utility, homeowners may wish to install solar energy to avoid potential future fluctuations in energy costs,
                        or they may simply wish to look beyond their financial motivations and use solar energy for a "green" life contributing to the well being of the environment.
